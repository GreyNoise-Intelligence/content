GreyNoise tells security analysts what not to worry about. We do this by curating data on IPs that saturate security
tools with noise. This unique perspective helps analysts confidently ignore irrelevant or harmless activity, creating
more time to uncover and investigate true threats

##### What does this pack do?
This pack allows for analysts to integrate the free, GreyNoise Community API data into their playbooks and workflows.
It gives them the ability to determine if an IPv4 address is something they need to worry about or is just
Internet-Background noise.

This pack is design specifically for GreyNoise Community users and only provides the subset of intel available via the
GreyNoise Community API.  The [GreyNoise Pack](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/Packs/GreyNoise) 
should be used by customers with a paid subscription to GreyNoise.

- Allows analysts to query an IP from GreyNoise and determine if it is Internet-Background Noise.
- Allows analysts to query an IP from GreyNoise and determine if it belongs to a benign service or provider.
